Round up prices automatically to avoid psychological pricing, reduce clutter, and make easy comparisons.

Price.99 gives your control over how prices are displayed on the page using a set of rounding rules. 

Donâ€™t like psychological pricing? Round all prices ending in .99 to the nearest dollar. Want to reduce clutter and see nice, round prices? Round up everything to the nearest $10. Shopping for a new gadget and need a quick-and-dirty way to compare prices? Round them up to the nearest hundred, or even to the nearest thousand.

Price.99 __DOES NOT__ change the actual price. You will not pay more.
